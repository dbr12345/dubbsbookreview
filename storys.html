                <p>Part 1:
                        For all of you who are reading this I just want you to know that i'm okay,
                        not okay in the sence of my mental state right now but okay in the sence that I'm safe,
                        safe from it. It being the things that are in my house right now. 
                        I'm not too sure what these things are but they scare me, I'm currently locked in the bathroom
                        with my 12 gauge and I'm just waiting for these things to come and try to break my door down and eat me. Paranoia was the first thing that I thought of when I saw these things, white face, slender body, their facial expressions are locked in a constant screem. They look like they're in a whole world of pain. I also feel like if these damned things get in here I'm going to be in just as much pain as they are. My gun is loaded... erm... I think. I'm not too sure, I don't do guns, this one was a gift from my father, he gave it to me because I was moving out as a 20 year old skinny white girl living in downtown of the big city. I tried to call the cops when I got locked in here but for some reason I no longer have any signal. My phone is also making weird noises, and the screen is starting to twitch. I don't know how much longer I will be able to keep typing for because it is starting to hear up but I will keep typing until it dies. I want to go out there and kill those things but I think that as long as I stick around in here, they won't be able to find me. Maybe they will go away in the morning... God, I hope they do. *Door crashes* *gunshot rings out* FUCK THEY'RE IN *two more gunshots ring out* HOLY SHIT! *one last gun shot rings out* COME GET SOME FUCKERS! *the sound of the gun failing to feed a new round can be heard* FUCK! *a loud clunking noise can be heard* ~cough, cough~ well, I guess that solves my issue for the night. I'm going to try to go to my room, I have a lock on the door so I should be safe in th- *ghoulish screems can be heard* fuck not again. *click, click.. boom* okay now I think that's the last of them. Like I said I'm going to try to make it to my room and lock the door, like I was about to say but got so rudely intrurupted, I should be safe in there after I lock the door. I am out of slugs so I'll have to stop by the garage before I can go to my room, I wan to make sure that I have a backup in case the things try to come in, if there are any more of them, God I hope there isn't, anyway I'll update you tomorrow morning. What could go wrong?  </p>
