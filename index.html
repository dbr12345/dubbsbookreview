                    This book is certainly one for the shelf, but it will mostly
                    be in the hand of the reader, this book is one of the best that I have ever
                    read. It has its moments of slowness, but in the end it is all worth it for the 
                    teeth clenching middle to end sections. The book is based in Hati, which is a very
                    interesting location to set a story in, but it certainly fits with the theme
                    of witchcraft and voodoo. The synopsis of the book reads as follows. "Crippled, unable to move,
                    Margal moves you instead, speaks to your mind, commands you to act. There are no doors you can lock to keep
                    The Evil out, nobarriers he cannot breach. He calls to those he needs, and they must obey, you must obey the whispers
                    in your mind, and the visions he causes to appear. Rivers rush, valleys flame, Margal touches your mind."
                    As you can see, this story is one of great value. You see Sam and Kay build their relationship and break it back down,
                    will Dr. Bell ever be found, you will need to read this gem to find out. Happy reading!
